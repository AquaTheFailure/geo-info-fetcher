# geo-info-fetcher
This project is a web application that gathers and displays various user details, including geolocation, IP address, browser information, battery status, and timezone. It uses the Geolocation API to retrieve latitude and longitude, which are then converted into an address using reverse geocoding. The IP address is fetched from an external API, and browser details such as user agent, screen resolution, and operating system are extracted using JavaScript. Additionally, the app includes a dynamic, scrollable interface with a built-in map to visualize the user's location. The goal is to provide a simple and interactive way to access key system and location details in one place.
